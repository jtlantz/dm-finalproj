# Data Mining Project

## Citation

```         
Hvitfeldt, E., & Silge, J. (2021). Supervised machine learning for text analysis in R. CRC Press.
```

Since we are using R there is quite a lot of unique syntax, so I will do my best to outline/explain it here.

This contains the packages that we will need for tokenization of our words in our dataset

```{r}
install.packages("tokenizers")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("tidytext")
```

Then we need to import those packages

```{r}
library(tokenizers)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
```

Load in our project

```{r}
dataset <- read.csv("../resources/raw-dataset.csv")
```

```{r}

```
